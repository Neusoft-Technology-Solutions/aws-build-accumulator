Version 1.2.0 -- 2021-02-24
---------------------------

- Litani now renders the HTML directory atomically. The `html` directory is now
  a symbolic link that is updated only after the report has been completely
  written.
- Added dark mode for all report pages


Version 1.1.0 -- 2021-02-03
---------------------------

- Added a new top-level command, `litani graph`. This dumps a
  Graphviz-formatted graph to stdout that describes the dependency graph
  of the jobs that have been added so far.
