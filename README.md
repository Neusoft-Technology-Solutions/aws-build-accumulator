AWS Build Accumulator
-

AWS Build Accumulator collects build jobs from multiple sources before executing them
concurrently. It provides platform-independent job control (timeouts,
return code control) and an output format that is easy to render into
reports (for example, using the built-in renderer).  AWS Build Accumulator
shines where your project uses multiple different build systems or requires
a unified interface describing heterogeneous build jobs.
